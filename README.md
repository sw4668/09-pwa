# Overview
Nosh is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to solve a common dilemma: choosing what to eat. Initially inspired by the often frustrating decision-making process associated with eating out, especially with friends, Nosh evolves this idea into a fun, engaging, and easy-to-use application.

# Design Process
Inspiration: The project began with a simple goal - to create a random food generator. The aim was to make meal decisions easier and more enjoyable.

Evolution: As the project progressed, a retro or 'old internet' aesthetic became a central theme. This design choice was driven by a desire to invoke nostalgia and offer a unique, playful user experience. The use of vibrant colors, animated GIFs of food items, and a starry background contributes to this retro feel. The choice to incorporate a galaxy background also humorously underscores the seemingly monumental and all-important nature of deciding what to eat.

# Process 
Coding and setup: I created a basic HTML and CSS setup with some font and color styling. The core functionality of the PWA revolves around a simple yet effective JavaScript implementation. The script  selects a random image from a predefined array of GIFs each time the user interacts with the application. This approach serves the app's primary purpose and adds an element of surprise and engagement to the user experience.

Icon Creation: The app icon was initially generated using an AI tool. I then turned to Photoshop to refine the aesthetic and technical requirements. This step involved resizing the icon to meet specific dimensions and making touch-ups to enhance its visual appeal.
